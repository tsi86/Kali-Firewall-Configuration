# Kali-Firewall-Configuration
A project demonstrating firewall configuration using iptables on Kali Linux to secure a web server, SSH, and a database.
This project aims to analyze and configure a firewall on a Kali Linux system to secure a minimal infrastructure. The scenario assumes the existence of a Linux server hosting:
•	A web server (Apache).
•	An SSH service (for remote administration).
•	A MariaDB database server configured to accept connections only from the web application hosted on the same server.
We will use iptables to configure the firewall and document each step of the process, explaining the implemented security rules.
