3.1 Checking Active Firewall Rules
To check the active rules:
sudo iptables -L -v
3.2 Testing Access to Services
1.	Access the web server at the IP address on port 80 to verify Apache functionality.
2.	Test SSH connections using port 2222:
ssh -p 2222 user@<server_IP>
3.	Confirm MariaDB only accepts local connections:
mysql -u root -p
3.3 Testing Unauthorized Connections Blocking
1.	Test connections on blocked ports (e.g., 23, 21):
nc -zv <server_IP> <port>
2.	Verify that the firewall correctly blocks unauthorized traffic.
